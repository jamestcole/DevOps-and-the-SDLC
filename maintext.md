# DevOps and the SDLC

##  How does DevOps fit into the SDLC?

The traditional software devolopment life cycle (SDLC) has a series of phases such as analysis, design 
and development. This became standard practice, partly because early devolopers were limited by a lack of
sufficiently capable computers that were expensive to run and had long compile times. Over time, the number
and complexity of phases in the SDLC were increased in many companies. If the main tool for solving software delivery issues is by using
phases and control steps, more sofware problems typically emerge. The process growing in size also increases the
transaction cost of each software version.
